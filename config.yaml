# DEFINE the samples - each sample should have a name, e.g. SAMPLE1
# and a path to the input file, e.g. data/sample1.fastq.gz
# VALID INPUTS: fastq, fastq.gz, CEL.gz
# NOTE: for PAIRED-END fastq/fastq.gz, give both pairs to the sample:
# SAMPLE_1_PE:
#   - data/sample1_pair1.fastq
#   - data/sample1_pair2.fastq
# WARNING: DO not mix Paired-END and Single-End samples!!!
# ALSO: having the string '.' in your sample name will throw an ERROR
# '.' causes Rscripts chop off names
# If you want to use geo_start.py, delete or comment whole "sample" part.
